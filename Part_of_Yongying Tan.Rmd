## Improving Compliance/Adherence with Development Agendas/Goals

 Integrated Flood Safety Plan (IFSP)
 
 Strategy for Air Pollution Control (SPPU)

· Water management: As the widespread pumping of groundwater is the human factor of sinking and flooding, it is necessary to pretend residents from doing it and worsen the situation.

· Planting trees: Investing in green infrastructure and planting trees will mitigate subsidence and enhance urban resilience, aligning with global climate action and sustainable city planning.

## Risks

1.Financial Constraints: Implementing solutions like effective water management, desalination of seawater, and investing in green infrastructure may require substantial financial investment. The cost and sources of funding for these projects could be a significant limitation.

2.Technical Challenges: The feasibility of implementing proposed solutions, such as the effectiveness of desalination in a large-scale urban context or the impact of green infrastructure on significantly mitigating land subsidence, might present technical limitations.

3.Environmental Impacts: While the solutions aim to address environmental issues, they could have unintended negative impacts. For example, large-scale desalination can affect marine ecosystems and biodiversity.

4.Long-term Sustainability: The long-term effectiveness and sustainability of the proposed solutions in the face of ongoing climate change and urban development pressures might be uncertain.
